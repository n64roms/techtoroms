<h2>Super Mario 64</h2>
Arguably the most iconic game on the N64, Super Mario 64 follows Mario as he tries to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser's castle. The game features open-world gameplay, allowing players to explore worlds and collect items at their own pace. The game is also notable for its revolutionary graphics and ground-breaking use of 3D gaming.
 
<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>
Another classic N64 game, Ocarina of Time follows Link as he travels through time to save Hyrule from Ganondorf. The game is considered one of the greatest video games of all time, thanks to its expansive world, memorable characters, and engrossing story. 
 
<h2>GoldenEye 007</h2>
GoldenEye was one of the first first-person shooters released on a console, and it remains one of the best. The game features a singleplayer campaign that follows James Bond as he tries to stop Trevelyan's plan for global domination, as well as a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to compete against each other in a variety of modes.
 
<h2>Conker's Bad Fur Day</h2>
Conker's Bad Fur Day is an unconventional platformer that is aimed at a more mature audience. The game stars Conker the Squirrel, who must find his way home after a night of heavy drinking. Along the way, Conker will encounter such enemies as Nazi Germans, crazed zombies, AND angry bears. The game is filled with crude humor and adult themes, making it one of the most unique titles on the N64.
